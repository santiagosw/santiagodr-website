## About Me 👨‍💻

I am currently a Software Engineer in Argentina 🇦🇷, where I spend most of my time writing backend API services, optimizing queries on multidimensional workloads, and conducting database research targeted towards the Fintech sector. I am also focused on optimizing the developer experience in general.

I work with a team of engineers and designers to create intuitive and responsive web applications for the smart locker industry 🔐.

In addition to my role at Luxer One, I also work as a Freelance Flutter Developer at Nolock Studio, where I design and develop mobile applications 📱 for various clients and domains. I build custom widgets and animations to create a unique user experience 🎨.
